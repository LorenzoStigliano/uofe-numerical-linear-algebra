    "We can see that the computation times of the algorithm increases as $n$ increases. This is what we expect. The growth is clearly not linear form the graph for $n$ values from 100 to 1500 this is because our algorithm has a $O(n^3)$ time complexity so as a result the time is upper bounded by a cubic with respect to the size of $n$ given. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Likewise we can see that the error of $\\widehat {\\mathbf x}$ increases as the size $n$ of the matrix increases. This also does not come as a suprise, this is because as we increase the dimensions of the matrix we have to do more computations and as a result we would expect our error to increase.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can see that the relationship between error and $n$ is linear, we can derive this from **Theorem 2.9** and **2.11** to see why this is the case.\n",

    "**Theorem 2.9** : Let $\\widehat {\\mathbf x}$ be the computed solution to (SLE) by Algorithm GEPP. Then $(A+∆A)\\widehat {\\mathbf x}= b$ , where, with $p(n)$ a cubic polynomial, <br><br>$$\\| ∆A\\|_{\\infty} \\leqslant p(n)2^{n-1}\\epsilon_{m}\\|A\\|_{\\infty} $$ <br>\n",

The growth is clearly not linear form the graph for $n$ values from 100 to 1500 this is because our algorithm has a $O(n^3)$ time complexity so as a result the time upper bounded by a cubic with respect to the size of $n$ given.\n",

However what is worth noting is that the errors for the same $n$ are greater for ill-condtioned matricies. This is because, if we use the derivation above, we can see that the error $\\| \\mathbf x - \\widehat {\\mathbf x}\\|_{\\infty}$ has a linear relationship with $\\kappa_{p}(A)p(n)2^{n-1}\\epsilon_{m}$. From the definition of $\\kappa_{p}(A)$ we can see that if matrix A is ill condtioned $\\kappa_{p}(A)$ is large. This means that $\\kappa_{p}(A_{well}) < \\kappa_{p}(A_{ill}) $ and so we have a term that is greater, so for matricies of the same size $n$ ,$\\kappa_{p}(A)p(n)2^{n-1}\\epsilon_{m}$ will be greater for ill- conditioned than for well-condtioned so as a reulst the error will also be greater.

For a fixed size $n$ for a matrix if we change the $\\kappa_{p}(A)$ value we can see that the time doesnt change proportionally since the time does not depend on the matrix if it is ill conditioned or not but rather on the size of the matrix, so since n = 100 is fixed for these matricies the time dont follow a linear relationship with repect to $\\kappa_{p}(A)$."
